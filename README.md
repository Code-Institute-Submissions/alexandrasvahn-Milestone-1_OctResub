User stories
<br>

Visitor goals 
I want people who visit this page to feel like they get to know me a little bit, and make an option to get to know me more if they want by
visiting diffrent social media links or contact me in a form. It contains links to my Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn page as well as my email. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

Design
<br>

Color scheme/design
I want my page to be simple but playful, therfor I have tried to make it feel a bit like a comic book and choosed to go with blue and red colors, align with the picture.

Imagery
The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also fun with the "its a job for" state in the picture. It might appear a bit edgy for some eyes, but at the same time that doesnt do me anything and its a site that should paint a picture of who I am.
